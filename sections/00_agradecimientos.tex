I would like to thank my supervisor, Pablo Neira Ayuso, for his guidance throughout this project. Iâ€™m both proud and grateful for my time working with Pablo.

I am indebted also to my colleagues, I could have never done it without the support that I found in this Technical School.


The first IT teacher that I ever had made me love the computer engineering and encouraged me to take this step forward, thank you, Jose Luis.

Immense gratitude to my family and specially, my friends, for their patience and support no matter what.

Many thanks to my cats and to anyone that ever made me a cup of tea.
