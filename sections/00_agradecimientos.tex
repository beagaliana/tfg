\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Pablo Neira Ayuso, for his guidance throughout this project. I’m both proud and grateful for my time working with Pablo.

Immense gratitude to my family and specially, my friends, for their patience and support no matter what.

Thanks to my highschool IT teacher, José Luis Nuñez, who ignited in me a curiosity for how computers work and eventually led me to choose this path.

Last but not least, many thanks to my cats and to anyone that ever made me a cup of tea.
