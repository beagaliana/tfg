There is little doubt about the importance of the challenge agriculture is facing nowadays: how to be able to supply the whole world increasing population without using up all the available, but limited, resources of our planet.

Optimizing agricultural procedures is absolutely paramount, and technology and innovation play a leading role in achieving a more efficient and sustainable production systems.

In this line of work, and as the aim of this project, we suggest carrying out a system that will daily assist the farmer by implementing agricultural sensors for the monitoring and control of the harvest. Thereby succeeding in creating a more ecological, environmentally friendly and competent way of managing both time and resources.
